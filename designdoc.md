## Features
1. Bottom Navigation Menu with four categories:
   - Videos
   - Library
   - Progress
   - Profile

2. Videos (Home Page)
   - Fetch and display videos from the Dreaming Spanish YouTube channel using the YouTube API
   - List videos in a scrollable view
   - Tap on a video to open and play it

3. Library
   - History section displaying watched videos
   - Saved videos section for videos marked as "watch later"

4. Progress
   - Display user's learning progress and streaks, similar to Duolingo
   - Show statistics such as total videos watched, total watch time, and current streak

5. Profile
   - Display user details
   - Settings section within the profile for app customization

## App Layout

### Bottom Navigation Menu
- Use React Navigation to create a bottom tab navigator with four tabs: Videos, Library, Progress, and Profile

### Videos (Home Page)
- Use the YouTube API to fetch videos from the Dreaming Spanish channel
- Store video metadata in Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore
- Display videos in a FlatList or ScrollView
- Each video item should show the video thumbnail, title, and duration
- Tapping on a video should navigate to a video player screen

### Library
- Implement a screen with two tabs: History and Saved
- Use Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore to store watched videos and saved videos
- History tab:
  - Display a list of watched videos
  - Each item should show the video thumbnail, title, and watch progress
- Saved tab:
  - Display a list of videos marked as "watch later"
  - Allow users to remove videos from the saved list

### Progress
- Create a screen to display the user's learning progress
- Use Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore to store user progress data
- Show a streak counter, similar to Duolingo, to track consecutive days of learning
- Display statistics such as total videos watched and total watch time
- Use charts or graphs to visualize progress over time

### Profile
- Use Firebase Authentication to handle user authentication and profile management
- Create a screen to display user details retrieved from Firebase Authentication
- Implement a settings section within the profile screen
- Store user preferences in Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore
- Settings options may include:
  - Theme selection (light/dark mode)
  - Notification preferences
  - Language selection for the app interface

## Data Management
- Use Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore for storing and retrieving data
- Store user progress, watched videos, and saved videos in the Firebase database
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions to handle any server-side logic or data processing

## API Integration
- Use the YouTube Data API to fetch videos from the Dreaming Spanish channel
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions to make requests to the YouTube API and retrieve video details
- Store the retrieved video metadata in the Firebase database

## UI/UX
- Follow React Native best practices and guidelines for creating a smooth and intuitive user experience
- Use a UI library like React Native Elements or NativeBase for pre-built components
- Ensure proper navigation flow and error handling

## Testing
- Write unit tests for critical components and functions
- Perform integration testing to ensure proper data flow and screen interactions
- Use Firebase Test Lab for testing on various devices and configurations
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback and iterate on the design
